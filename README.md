 Restaurant Ordering aims at replacing the conventional menu system which is time consuming and old fashioned. Meal orders can be taken on an iPAD/Android Tab, which will have the complete menu offered by the restaurant.These orders are now directly projected on the admin dashboard as “Order of example item placed on table number 2”. Each menu item, under any category comes with a description of the item for better understanding of the item, along with it’s cost.
